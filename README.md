# hello-world
my first github repository
i am trying my best to become at least a front end web developer by the end of the summer
this means that i need to practice in flat iron, codecademy, odin, udemy, and through youtube
it is going to take a lot of work, but i know that i can do this. as long as i can commit to a few hours a day
